#Contributing

Absolutely! Contributing to this module is very much encouraged. But please adhere to the following rules, to keep everything neat and tidy.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

#### Be open, collaborative and curious 

* Experiment with your code and share the results.
* Ask questions if you get stuck.
* If you can answer questions, be responsive and help guide others towards solutions.
* Share code and knowledge that might help others.
* The community is first and foremost about people sharing their knowledge to build something great together.

#### Be empathetic, friendly and considerate.

* Welcome and encourage participation from everyone that wishes to join and contribute to our community.
* Remember, growing the community socially is just as important as code related matters.
* Be respectful and honour diversity in our community. Sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can offend those around you and are not appropriate.
* Keep your actions lawful, non-discriminatory, and unthreatening towards others.

#### Respect the readerâ€™s time.

* Be concise and read over things before you post.
* Mind your words; you write a single time but what you write will be read by many. Being abusive, mean spirited and swearing at others do nothing to help get your points across nor do they drive constructive collaboration and hence stimulate contributions to open source.
* Be clear about who you are representing when responding; are you speaking on behalf of another business or acting in your capacity as an individual community member? Either is fine and both are encouraged. Just make it clear to the reader.


#### Respect different levels of participation.

* Welcome newcomers. Spend some time helping them to get orientated in our community.
* All contributors and core committers, module maintainers and knowledge sharers are participating in the community in a voluntary nature. Have respect for them and their time when making requests. You may need to exercise some patience.
* Whenever possible, reference your comments to others with example code or links to documentation. This helps people learn and become more experienced community members and developers.
* If you manage to solve your own problem, tell others how you solved it. This will help people in the future who have to solve similar problems.
* If you are reducing your input, and potentially stepping away from the community, please remember that others might be relying on your contributions. Be prepared to ensure your contributions remain open and available to the community. Spend some time handing your contributions over to another community member or core contributor to help with the continuity of SilverStripe open source development.

#### Resolve conflicts directly

* Conflict may eventuate from time to time. We should all try to view it as a constructive process. Understanding others' positions, without descending into ad hominem attacks, is valuable and may lead to better solutions to problems.
* Involve a 3rd party. If necessary, inform a core committer if a conflict continues to escalate.
* Breaches of the code of conduct by a community member may result in a first reminder about the code of conduct (we realise we're all human and sometimes we have bad days).
* Repeated and deliberate breachings of the code of conduct following this first reminder will be referred on to the team of core committers and may result in the member being asked to leave the community channels.
* While we have a policy of not removing postings and comments from our digital channels, there may be times in which items are removed if deemed blatantly discriminatory towards individuals, groups or cultures.
* If a member behaves inappropriately, politely bring this to their attention and gently remind them of the code of conduct when necessary.
* Refer to this [helpful guide on conflict resolution][http://www.crnhq.org/files/66138/files/Handouts%20and%20Posters/ResolveTheConflictGuideposter.pdf] to aid you when dealing with a conflict.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation 
of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.


### Attribution
